-Easier to load in data from csv, perform basic operations on data sets
-parsing strings into dates and time, sorting out chars like '$' also helpful
-Handling NaN: can sort it out, replace with a value, and mean and sum ops ignore


-Creates nice charts for you!!!!!
-Describe gives you useful stats if you can't be bothered to do it yourself: mean, median, std deviation, percentiles, min, max, count


-Can do SQL-type stuff for you; if you really have a grudge against SQL, you can use a lighter database with pandas
     *sorting data by a certain coloumn
     *transforming data columns, taking the right bits of data, all that fun stuff.

-Hierarchical indexing:
     *not sure what this is; look into it
     *"rotating": swapping cols and rows easily
     
-Merging different columns into one object, i.e. name, age, income --> a dict
-This makes it easier to sort out different things by a characteristic (teams with more than 100 wins in a season and everything about them, highly rated movies, etc.)
